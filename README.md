## Nearby Search API

### Instructions

There are two folders:

- client
- server

In each folder, there is an `.env.sample` file. Save as those files and enter the appropriate values.

In the terminal, `cd` into the client directory and run `yarn && yarn dev`. In a new terminal, `cd` in the server directory and run `yarn && yarn start`. Both client and server would need to be run to use this API.
